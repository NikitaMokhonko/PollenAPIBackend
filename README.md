# Pollen Forecast Backend

Hello!

This is the backend part of my pollen forecast website project, made using **Java** and more specifically, **Spring Web**.

The data for this project is fetched from an external API, and processed to send out a value between 0 and 7, signifying the severity of pollen count.

These values are then processed and displayed in my [frontend](https://github.com/NikitaMokhonko/PollenAPIFrontend).
